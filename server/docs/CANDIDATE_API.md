## üèóÔ∏è **RESTful Design Principles Applied**

### **HTTP Methods Used Correctly:**
- **GET** - Retrieve data (profile, applications, bookmarks)
- **POST** - Create new resources (apply, bookmark, upload)
- **PUT** - Complete resource updates (profile, settings)
- **PATCH** - Partial updates (specific profile sections, notes)
- **DELETE** - Remove resources (withdraw, unbookmark, delete)

### **Resource Naming:**
- **Plural nouns** for collections: `/applications`, `/bookmarks`
- **Hierarchical structure**: `/profile/photo`, `/notifications/preferences`
- **Action verbs only when necessary**: `/password/change`, `/account/deactivate`

### **Status Codes:**
- **200** - Successful GET/PUT/PATCH operations
- **201** - Successful POST operations (creating resources)
- **404** - Resource not found
- **409** - Conflict (e.g., already applied to job)
- **400** - Bad request (validation errors)

---

## üîí **Security & Validation**

### **Authentication Middleware:**
```javascript
router.use(authenticateToken);        // JWT verification
router.use(requireRole('CANDIDATE')); // Role-based access control
```

### **Data Validation:**
- Input validation for all PATCH/PUT operations
- File upload validation for resumes and photos
- Business logic validation (e.g., can't withdraw allocated applications)

### **Error Handling:**
- Consistent error response format
- Detailed error messages for debugging
- Graceful handling of database errors

---

## üìä **Advanced Features**

### **1. Profile Completeness Scoring**
```javascript
// Intelligent recommendations based on missing fields
const recommendations = [];
if (!candidate.resumeUrl) recommendations.push('Upload your resume');
if (!candidate.profilePhoto) recommendations.push('Add a profile photo');
```

### **2. Smart Job Recommendations**
- City-based job filtering
- Skill matching algorithms
- Exclude already applied jobs
- Employer verification status

### **3. Application Status Tracking**
- **APPLIED** ‚Üí **SCREENED** ‚Üí **ALLOCATED** ‚Üí **HIRED/REJECTED**
- Withdraw capability for early-stage applications only
- Comprehensive application history

### **4. Activity Feed**
- Combined timeline of applications and bookmarks
- Chronologically sorted activity stream
- Rich data context for each activity

---

## üöÄ **Production Readiness Features**

### **Performance Optimizations:**
- Pagination for all list endpoints
- Selective field loading with Prisma `select`
- Efficient database queries with proper `include`
- Parallel database operations with `Promise.all`

### **Scalability:**
- UUID primary keys for distributed systems
- Stateless JWT authentication
- Database connection pooling
- Modular controller architecture

### **Monitoring & Analytics:**
- Comprehensive logging for all operations
- Application statistics and insights
- Profile view tracking capabilities
- Market trend analysis foundations
